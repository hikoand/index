  <h1>Pokemon GO! 포켓몬고!</h1>
  At Niantic, our goal is to <strong>create <u>experiences</u> that encourage healthy outdoor exploration and social gameplay</strong>. With Pokémon GO, players can explore their neighborhoods and cities to find wild Pokémon. They can discover and catch hundreds of Pokémon, take Pokémon into battle, collect items, hatch and train new Pokémon, and more.
    What about safety? Is the Pokémon GO app dangerous to use?

  <p style="text-indent:10px;"> Pokémon GO is designed to be played outdoors.It carries with it some of the risks of any outdoor activity including hiking, biking, or playing sports in a park. Users should always remain aware of their environment and avoid going into any inappropriate areas, or any area where they are not permitted to be. Pedestrians should remain aware of hazards, including other pedestrians, traffic and obstacles. As with any mobile app, Pokémon GO should not be operated while driving a vehicle. This is reinforced by warnings and behaviors within the app and it’s vital that people be responsible and not play while driving. Parents should guide and supervise their children’s use of the product, including where to play and how to use a mobile phone app safely. To help remind players of the risks and to encourage everyone to play safely, the Pokémon GO app cautions users about safety and awareness each time it is started.</p>
  <p style="text-indent:10px;">Niantic collects information in order to operate the game and to optimize and improve our products and services. Niantic does not sell any adult’s or child’s user information to third parties. Niantic game sponsors receive only aggregate information about the number of visits and player actions at their locations. For example, a restaurant chain sponsor would only get information about aggregate visits and actions at their locations.</p>
